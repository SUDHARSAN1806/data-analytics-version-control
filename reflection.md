\# Reflection — Version Control Using Git and GitHub



\*\*Name:\*\* Sudharsan(22MIA1136)  

\*\*Course:\*\* CSE3505 — Foundations of Data Analytics  

\*\*Digital Assignment-03:\*\* Version Control Using Git and GitHub  



---



\### What I Did

I installed Git on my computer and configured my username and email.  

Then I created a local repository called \*\*data-analytics-version-control\*\*, added files (`README.md` and `data\_cleaning.py`), and made my first commit.  

Finally, I created a GitHub repository and pushed my local project online using HTTPS authentication with a personal access token.



\### What I Learned

\- How to initialize and manage a Git repository.  

\- The workflow of adding, committing, and pushing changes.  

\- The importance of version control for tracking progress and collaborating.  

\- How to securely authenticate to GitHub using a personal access token.



\### Challenges \& Solutions

At first, I had trouble accessing the correct Desktop path and understanding how to use the token as a password.  

I fixed this by using the correct OneDrive path and carefully following each Git command.



\### Next Steps

I plan to learn branching, merging, and collaboration on GitHub to manage group projects more efficiently.
